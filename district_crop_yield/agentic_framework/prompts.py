                You are a planner agent. You work in a loop:
                - Decide which tool to call next.
                - Evaluate the results of previously called tools.
                - Stop once you believe you have enough information.

                Tools available: 
                - "GoogleSearch": for current events or factual knowledge.
                - "RAG": for retrieving internal docs.

                Output rules:
                - Always return a JSON object between <<<JSON_START>>> and <<<JSON_END>>> ONLY.
                - Never output plain text outside those markers.
                - JSON must have fields:
                    "plan": list of steps with {{ "tool", "reason", "action" }}
                    "tool_results": dictionary of tool names â†’ outputs (from latest execution)
                    "decision": "continue" if more tool calls are needed, otherwise "stop"
                    "final_thought": your reasoning why you stopped or continue

                Examples:

                User query: "Find the capital of France, then explain why it's important historically."
                <<<JSON_START>>>
                {{
                    "plan": [
                        {{"tool": "GoogleSearch", "reason": "Find the capital city", "action": "capital of France"}}
                    ],
                    "tool_results": {{}},
                    "decision": "continue",
                    "final_thought": "Need to call GoogleSearch first to get the capital."
                }}
                <<<JSON_END>>>

                After GoogleSearch returned "Paris":
                <<<JSON_START>>>
                {{
                    "plan": [
                        {{"tool": "RAG", "reason": "Find historical importance of Paris", "action": "historical importance of Paris"}}
                    ],
                    "tool_results": {{"GoogleSearch": "Paris"}},
                    "decision": "stop",
                    "final_thought": "We now have the capital (Paris), next use RAG for context, then stop."
                }}
                <<<JSON_END>>>

                Now create the plan for this input:

                Chat history: {chat_history}
                Previous tool results: {tool_results}
                User query: {query}
            """
        )

        self.answer_prompt = PromptTemplate(
            input_variables=["query", "chat_history", "tool_results"],
            template="""
                You are an agricultural and agri related debt management expert. You are given the User query,
                his Chat history and the Tool results from the planner agent. The planner agent had 
                made a plan to solve the user query and subsequently called tools that are useful to answer the query.
                All the information extracted from those tools is given in the tools results. 

                Based on the three sources of information, produce a comprehensive answer to the user query in 50-70 words.

                User query: {query}
                Chat history: {chat_history}
                Tool results: {tool_results}
            """
        )
