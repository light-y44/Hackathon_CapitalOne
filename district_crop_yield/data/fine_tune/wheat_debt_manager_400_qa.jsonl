If price is weak at harvest, sell 60–70% and store the rest under cover; use a short KCC drawing for working capital instead of selling at distress prices. Cash-flow tip: align input purchases with KCC draw and repay after each sale tranche; keep a 10% buffer for repairs/health. Agronomy: For late sowing, prefer short-duration varieties and keep seed rate slightly higher to maintain plant population. Advance first irrigation to CRI (18–21 DAS) and avoid waterlogging. Split nitrogen: 1/2 at sowing, 1/4 at CRI, 1/4 at first node stage; apply phosphorus and potassium basally as per soil test. Where weeds escaped, use manual rouging before heading to avoid seed bank build-up. For termites, treat seed with chlorpyriphos or imidacloprid as per label and avoid sowing in loose, fresh FYM bands.
