The store should be free from leaks, and the walls and floor should be made of materials that do not absorb moisture.\n\nCleanliness: A clean store reduces the likelihood of pest infestation. Any spilled grain or produce should be promptly cleaned up, and the store should be regularly swept and sanitized.\n\nPest monitoring: Regular inspection of stored crops is essential to detect any signs of pest infestation early. Traps or baits can be used to monitor and control pests.\n\nPest control: If pests are detected, appropriate control measures should be taken immediately. This can include the use of insecticides, fumigation, or physical removal of infested crops.\n\nProper storage containers: Crops should be stored in appropriate containers, such as airtight containers, to prevent pests from entering. The containers should be made of materials that do not release harmful chemicals or odors that can affect the quality of the stored crops.\n\nProper storage location: The store should be located away from sources of pests, such as animal pens or garbage dumps.

Calm or gentle breezes help ensure that the pesticide is applied to the target plants without being carried away to non-target areas.\n\nPest activity: Many pests, such as insects and mites, tend to be more active during the early morning hours. By spraying at this time, the pesticide can directly target and control the pests while they are actively feeding or moving.\n\nPreservation of beneficial insects: Spraying in the morning allows beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies, to forage on flowers and perform pollination activities during the day. Since these insects are crucial for crop pollination and ecological balance, it is important to minimize their exposure to pesticides.

Thoroughly clean the storage containers or structures to remove any existing infestations.\n\nProper storage containers: Use airtight containers, such as metal or plastic bins with tight-fitting lids, to store beans. This helps prevent weevils from entering and infesting the beans. Avoid using jute bags or other porous materials that can allow pest entry.\n\nTemperature control: Weevils thrive in warm temperatures. Keeping the storage area cool can help deter their growth and reproduction. Maintain a temperature below 15 degrees Celsius if possible.\n\nMoisture control: Weevils require moisture to survive and reproduce. Ensure that the beans are properly dried before storage to reduce moisture content. Use moisture-absorbing substances like silica gel packets or dry ash in the storage containers to keep the environment dry.\n\nNatural repellents: Some natural substances act as repellents to weevils. These include dried neem leaves, mint leaves, or tobacco leaves. Place small sachets of these repellents in the storage containers to deter weevils.\n\nFreezing or heating: If feasible, beans can be subjected to extreme temperatures to eliminate weevils. Freezing the beans for a few days at temperatures below -18 degrees Celsius or heating them at temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius can kill the pests.\n\nRegular monitoring: Regularly inspect the stored beans for signs of weevil infestation, such as holes in the beans or presence of adult weevils. If infestation is detected, separate and discard the infested beans to prevent further spread."}]}

These may include adjusting planting density, optimizing nutrition and irrigation practices, and practicing crop rotation. Some diseases may be controlled by removing alternate host plants or weeds that can serve as reservoirs for the pathogens.\n\nSeek expert advice: Consult local agricultural extension services, agricultural experts, or plant pathologists for specific recommendations on disease management strategies.

For example, maize can act as a \"trap crop\" for certain pests, diverting them away from groundnuts. Additionally, groundnuts release certain compounds into the soil that can suppress certain soil-borne diseases, benefiting both crops.\n\nEfficient land use: Intercropping allows for the efficient use of limited land resources, as you can cultivate two different crops in the same area.
